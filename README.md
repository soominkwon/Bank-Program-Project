# Bank-Program-Project
C++ Bank Program Project

This banking project is a bank-like simulation written in the software programming language C++.

There are two sets of instructions, (1) and (2), for this project. Please read in detail before attempting to compile.
Additionally, there are three files as well. Please consider all before compilation.

**PLEASE NOTE**:
This program is not perfect - there are "loops" that may break the program.

Please be patient with it, however, there are less errors in this program compared to the "Stock Program Project",
located in a different repository.
